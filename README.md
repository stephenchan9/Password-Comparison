# Password-Comparison

Language: C++

Program is designed to retrieve 2 passwords from the user and encrypt them in order to be compared. The passwords will be compared and a message will be displayed to the screen if the passwords are the same or different.

Design:
A class is used to store a single password as well as the encrypted password. Funcions within the class allow for the password to be compared and encrypted. Getline is used to read the entire user input for the password in order for whitespaces to be read. The passwords are encrypted by using a key that hashes the value and stores it within the class. While loop is used to execute the program again.
